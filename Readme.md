# Node.js Chicago June 2014

In June 2014, I gave a talk at the [Chicago Node.js Meetup](www.meetup.com/Chicago-Nodejs/events/172986572). In this repository, you'll find several projects that show off the open source contributions I've made as part of [The Machine](http://machine.fm) and [Mixdown](http://mixdown.co) projects.
